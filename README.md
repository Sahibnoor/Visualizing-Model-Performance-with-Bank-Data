# 🏦 Visualizing Model Performance with Bank Data

This project was completed as part of the **Data Science for Business (Course 657)** in the MSBA program at **UMass Amherst – Isenberg School of Management**. The objective was to build and evaluate classification models using bank marketing data, and to effectively visualize and interpret model performance for business decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective

To apply classification techniques on bank customer data to predict term deposit subscription outcomes, and to compare models using evaluation metrics and visualizations.

## 📁 Project Components

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handled categorical encoding
  - Standardized numerical features
  - Split data into training and test sets

- **Model Development:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve & AUC
  - Precision-Recall Curve
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

- **Visualization:**
  - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visually interpret model effectiveness
  - Plotted comparative performance charts across models

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
